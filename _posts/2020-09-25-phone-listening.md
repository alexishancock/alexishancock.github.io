## TLDR

No girl.

## Longer Answer

Inspired from a conversation from my co-workers yesterday, I wanted to carve this out in a way that people can get a better understanding of targeted advertisement.

### 'But this ad popped up right after a phone conversation!'

I know, it's creepy. Many times you may feel that this is generated from some sort of audio. The whacky world of phone permissions allows for some sort of audio to be recorded and logged in some way. For example, Alexa logs the audio commands you tell it. However, if your microphone was on all day sending audio to some server, the battery drain and the amount of sheer space a company would need to log everyone's conversations would be astronomical. It's much easier to target data you probably are passively giving and correlate it with your traffic as you browse the web and various mobile applications.

Say, that I know your name, and tomorrow I know you will likely arrive at work. It's easier to target that pattern, than to listen in on your phone to see if you will arrive at work. It's easier to map your purchases, web browsing, the apps you used, the accounts you have, etc. Than to parse out real time audio feeds.

People are generally predictable in many more ways than you think. Which leads me to my next point.

### You Aren't Unique, :0

Despite what you may hear on social media about how racial groups spend and different class groups spend, a large amount of average American consumers, Black - white - etc, have pretty similar consumer habits.

### ISPs and your Info

Unfortunately, thanks to the orange administration:

>_"In 2016, the FCC mandated that ISPs would have to obtain consent for information harvesting, but officials from the Trump administration rescinded these regulations back in 2017, before Congress rejected them, and Trump signed his ISP Privacy Bill into law in April 2017. This made harvesting information absolutely legal. So users in the US have very few protections unless they use a VPN."_

This has many implications. Your internet provider might not be logging just your traffic, but anyone else who has used your WiFi as a guest. All it takes is once to correlate an I.P. address with another piece of info.

Other ways of correlating someone in your network is sharing your contacts. That's a permission that is common of many social media applications.

### The Truth is Kind of Worse than the Hypothesis

If you were on social media for 10 years, that's 10 years worth of clicks - likes - and interaction. Data-brokers may know you better than you know yourself at times...and that is probably worse than your phone spying on you 24/7.

### No, not all hope is lost

Surveillance capitalism sucks, I know.

To start, especially if you are using a data leaking browser like Chrome, install the [Privacy Badger extension](https://privacybadger.org/). I am not giving a comprehensive list in this post, so if you want more info [my job has a bunch](https://ssd.eff.org/en/module-categories/tool-guides). Also, yell at your local senators and representatives about better data privacy law. It's the only way to force these companies to stop their practices in their tracks. California has the CCPA in effect, and that's a small start.

No, your phone is not listening to you. Surveillance capitalism is just out of control.
