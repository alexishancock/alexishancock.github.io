<p>So, I went to the Makerfaire in San Mateo, CA a few weeks ago and felt inspired to crack out my dormant hardware skills.</p>

<p>I went to one of my favorite sites, <a href="http://sparkfun.com/" target="_blank">Sparkfun.com</a>, and ordered a digital watch kit that helped me refresh my soldering skills. I live for building and making things. So I cracked open the box and my new soldering kit.</p>

<p>In high school I was in an engineering draft program that not only taught me Autocad and Inventor but hardware components as well. It was a great 2 year program; despite me being the only girl in school (out of 300 in my class) that enrolled. The smell of hot metal was missed and I was able to get back into my flow just one component in.</p>

<p>Enjoy the pics and <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11734" target="_blank">this is the link to the kit</a></p>
