        Raspberry Pi 3
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>What I code on</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        Late 2011 Mac Book Pro (sue me). Gutted out somewhat with a new battery, 500GB SSD, and maxed out at 16GB of RAM

I unwrapped my new Raspberry Pi 3 and immediately put it to work. I installed and flashed an image on an SD Card from the <a target="_blank" href="https://opensource.com/article/17/5/internet-in-a-box-raspberry-pi">Internet in a Box project.</a> I was interested in how to configure an at home set up for people who don't have access to a proper internet connection. To do things like research, study various subjects, and when connected online, download more information.</p>
<p>
    I used:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Raspberry Pi 3
    </li>
    <li>
        CanaKit Raspberry Pi 3 with 2.5A Micro USB Power Supply 
    </li>
    <li>
        iUniker Raspberry Pi 3 B+ Case
    </li>
    <li>
        64 GB MicroSD card. (I recommend 32 GB since I ran into issues with this size with FAT32 formatting)
    </li>
</ul>
