	<h1>Alexis Hancock</h1>
	<p>Curious Web Developer</p>
	<p>I would really like to learn all things web development.</p>
	<p>I'm realistic though. One Lynda class and project at a time.</p>
	<p>I like working with others on collaborative projects that make the internet accessible and better.</p>

	<p>
		I do not work in intolerant and racist environments. I am a Black woman who just wants to develop great products and would like to do so without microagressions and deliberate intolerance towards who I am. I believe there is no such thing as a "typical" look for a programmer. Every programmer I come across has different stories and repositories of knowledge.
