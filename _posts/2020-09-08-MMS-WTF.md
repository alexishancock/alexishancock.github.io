<p>What the fuck is wrong with MMS?</p>

<p>
For many years I have had problems with this format. Where images may not download. Or I simply would be blocked from downloading the MMS formatted message completely.
</p>

<p>
I will say Signal has handled MMS pretty well despite the many problems with this format.
</p>

<p>
I have never used iPhone, but heard that iMessage is the default pathway to deliver messsage. Hence the higher quality.

<p>
Either way, it's 2020. I know the world is on fire. So MMS gods, get to this when you can.
