As a long time Android user, who has dabbled back and forth between distros of Android, I would very much like to use basic functions of my phone. Many other users enjoy the features of Google Assistant. It helps schedule appointments, search the web, tell you the weather, etc. There are even [Routines](https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/7029585?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&hl=en) now you can set in your Android.

But here I am in my privacy rant mode once again. Not able to bring myself to use very useful features. For Google Assistant to be fully utilized, I have to turn on something called [Web & App Activity](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/54068?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en)

From their site:
>_"If Web & App Activity is turned on, your searches and activity from other Google services are saved in your Google Account, so you may get more personalized experiences, like faster searches and more helpful app and content recommendations."_

So accessing my calendar, contact, mic, web, and phone permissions simply aren't enough? I need to give added access just to give a voice command to do a web search or set an appointment in my calendar? That's ridiculous.

Google Assistant should have an offline mode and a mode that isn't tied to Web & App Activity. It's that simple. Until then I will be on the search for an offline assitant.

Not everything needs to be in the f***ing cloud.
